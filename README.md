# Loan-Defaulter-Segmentation-EDA

About the dataset:

This dataset serves as an illustrative example of how EDA can be used in a practical business scenario. Specifically, it showcases the use of data in the context of risk analytics within the banking and financial services industry. One of the key challenges that banks, and financial institutions face is the risk of losing money when lending to customers. This risk arises from a variety of factors, including economic conditions, market volatility, and customer behavior.

To mitigate this risk, banks and financial institutions use a variety of techniques, including credit scoring, fraud detection, and risk assessment. These techniques rely heavily on data analysis, and as such, EDA plays a crucial role in ensuring that accurate and reliable insights are obtained from the available data.

The dataset provides a basic understanding of how banks and financial institutions use data to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers. It highlights the importance of EDA in identifying patterns and trends within the data, which can be used to make informed decisions and develop effective risk management strategies. By leveraging data and EDA techniques, banks and financial institutions can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, identify potential risks, and ultimately reduce the likelihood of financial losses.

Business Understanding:

As an employee of a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers, I am tasked with utilizing EDA to analyze loan application patterns. The company faces the challenge of deciding whether to approve loan applications based on the applicant's profile, with the two main risks being the loss of potential business if a worthy applicant is rejected and the potential financial loss if a defaulting applicant is approved.

The loan application dataset includes information on two types of scenarios: clients with payment difficulties who have had late payments on at least one of the first few loan instalments, and all other cases where payments are made on time.
The dataset also provides information on four types of decisions that can be taken by the client/company: approved, cancelled, refused, and unused offer. An approved loan means that the company has granted the loan application, while a cancelled loan indicates that the client has decided to cancel the application at some point during the approval process. A refused loan means that the company has rejected the loan application due to the client not meeting the necessary requirements. Lastly, an unused offer occurs when a loan has been cancelled by the client at different stages of the process. The objective of using EDA on this dataset is to identify patterns and trends that can assist in the decision-making process and ensure that worthy applicants are not rejected.

Data Understanding:

2. 'previous_application.csv'
It contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

3. 'columns_description.csv'
